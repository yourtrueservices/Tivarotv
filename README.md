The application does not include IPTV credentials or channel lists. A valid provider profile is required before its interface unlocks.

## Managed catalog registry

`addon-registry.json` is generated and cryptographically signed by the Tivaro-TV Admin utility. Customer installations reject modified remote registries and keep the last verified copy when GitHub or an add-on is temporarily unavailable.

The initial registry contains metadata/catalog and subtitle services only. It does not bundle torrent scrapers, piracy providers, IPTV subscriptions, or private access tokens.

Movie and show playback is resolved only through enabled admin-managed add-ons that return authorized direct stream URLs. IPTV provider connections are used only for account validation and live channels.
